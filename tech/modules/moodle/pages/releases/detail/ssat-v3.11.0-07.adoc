== Summary

Two key areas in this release:

* upstream bug fixes and security patches to 18/03/2022
* adds new functionality via Filter Codes plugin


== Required configuration checks

=== Enable the filter codes plugin

. Enable for Content (settings will autosave)

=== OAuth2 field mapping checks

The code now picks up the field mappings from the UI settings, even for critical fields, so need to make sure they are all set correctly.

. Login to Moodle with admin rights
. Go to `/admin/tool/oauth2/issuers.php` and find the row relating to the SSAT SSO.
. Click on the user icon.

== SSAT code changes

The update to Moodle v3.11.6+ has included some changes to OAuth2 code, an area of the core system that we have modified.

The incoming changes have been manually merged.

Updated versions of the impacted classes have been copied onto the https://bitbucket.org/ssat/moodle/commits/7f05a278ad2141bb8441aba647254ed804cfb63e[tip of branch `ssat-v3.11.0-OAuth2-changes`]. As this branch is based from the start of version 3.11, we will be able to make a rebased copy when we start to customise version 4.
