= Code Repositories

== Overview

NOTE: This information needs updating to take account of our Vagrant setup for local development

Our approach to managing Moodle is based around multiple interlinked Git repositories. The relationship at the top-level (Moodle itself) is shown in this diagram.

We have similar repository setups for any third-party plugins we add to our build:

NOTE: Sub-module list needs to be updated. For definitive answer check the code!

The sub-modules in use are:

== Setting up local clone

To start developing locally run the following

[source,shell]
----
> git clone git@bitbucket.org:ssat/moodle.git
> git submodule update --recursive
----

If you are also going to be pulling in Moodle updates to either update our fork of Moodle, or to do integration work (updating our changes to work with a later version of Moodle). then you also need to do:

[source,shell]
----
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git
----

If you are going to be contributing bugfixes back to the Moodle community you also need a remote for our Github fork of the upstream:

[source,shell]
----
> git remote add contrib https://github.com/ssatuk/moodle.git
----

== Adding a new plugin to our build

1. locate the github repository for the plugin - this is our **upstream**
2. fork the repository in Github into a new repository under the `ssatuk` organisation - this becomes **origin**
3. follow the instructions to <<section-start-submodule,add the plugin to main repository>>
