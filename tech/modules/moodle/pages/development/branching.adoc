== Moodle core release train

To understand how the core Moodle team use branches, and by extension how we use them, you need to understand a little about the upstream development process. Moodle is under continual development by the core team, on the following schedule:

[options = "header" cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===

|Release type
|Example
|Frequency
|Phasing

|Major
|3.7
|Twice per year
|May, Nov

|Minor
|3.6.1
|Six times per year
|Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov

|Bugfix
|Weekly release 3.6.4+
|Weekly
|Thursday

|===

== How Moodle core team use branches and tags
[[section-moodle-branches]]
=== Branches

These are (some of) the branches you will find in the repository that have originated from the upstream:

[options = "header" cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Branch
|Purpose
|Comment

|master
|Ongoing Moodle development by core team
|The only thing we EVER do with master is to fetch from upstream (them) and push to origin (us). 


|MOODLE_XX_STABLE
|Current stable release of Moodle, e.g. MOODLE_36_STABLE is the latest stable state of 3.6 (including minor releases such as 3.6.1 )
|The only things we EVER do with MOODLE_XX_STABLE branches is to fetch from upstream (them) and push to origin (us), and merge bug fixes from them into our integration branches. 

|===

[[section-moodle-tags]]
=== Tags

The Moodle core team adds a tag every time a new major (3.X) or minor (3.X.Y) version is released. 

So for example if you look at the MOODLE_36_STABLE branch you might see something like this (arrow points to parent, as that is how the Directed Acyclic Graph inside git  works):

////
to build the graph you need this code, see https://jsfiddle.net/julianelve/qky2t59o/51/

----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Load the JS file -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@gitgraph/js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- DOM element in which we'll mount our graph -->
  <div id="graph-container"></div>
  </body>
----

----
/ Get the graph container HTML element.
    const graphContainer = document.getElementById("graph-container");

    // Instantiate the graph.
    const gitgraph = GitgraphJS.createGitgraph(graphContainer, {
    	orientation: "vertical",
      template: "blackarrow",
      reverseArrow: true,
      commitDefaultOptions: {
      		author:"Me"
      } ,
      
    });

    // Simulate git commands with Gitgraph API.
    const m36 = gitgraph.branch("MOODLE_36_STABLE");
    m36.commit({subject:"3.6 release", author:"a_dev"}).tag("v3.6.0")
    	.commit({subject:"A bugfix", author:"a_dev"})
    	.commit({subject: "weekly release 3.6.0+", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject:"minor change", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject: "weekly release 3.6.0+", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject: "Moodle release 3.6.1", author:"another"}).tag("v3.6.1")
    	.commit({subject: "bugfix", author:"me"});

When the core team start work on a new major release they branch from the start of the previous release:

// Get the graph container HTML element.
    const graphContainer = document.getElementById("graph-container");

    // Instantiate the graph.
    const gitgraph = GitgraphJS.createGitgraph(graphContainer, {
    	orientation: "vertical",
      template: "blackarrow",
      reverseArrow: true,
      //mode: "compact",
      commitDefaultOptions: {
      		author:"Me"
      } ,
      
    });

    // Simulate git commands with Gitgraph API.
    const m36 = gitgraph.branch("MOODLE_36_STABLE");
    m36.commit({subject:"3.6 release", author:"a_dev"}).tag("v3.6.0")
    const m37 = gitgraph.branch("MOODLE_37_STABLE")
    
    m36.commit({subject:"A bugfix", author:"a_dev"})
    	.commit({subject: "weekly release 3.6.0+", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject:"minor change", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject: "weekly release 3.6.0+", author:"another"})
    	.commit({subject: "Moodle release 3.6.1", author:"another"}).tag("v3.6.1")
    	.commit({subject: "bugfix", author:"me"});
    
    m37.commit({subject:"A feature", author:"a_dev"})
       .commit({subject:"A cherry-pick", author:"a_dev"})
       .commit({subject:"Final integration", author:"a_dev"})
       .commit({subject:"Moodle release 3.7.0", author:"a_dev"}).tag("v3.7.0")

[[section-ssat-branches]]
=== Branches

[options = "header" cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Branch
|Purpose
|Comment

|ssat-X.Y.Z-deployment
|SSAT deployment branch
|This is the branch we deploy onto the production server. It should only ever point at tested working code.


|ssat-X.Y.Z-integration
|SSAT integration branch  based on Moodle vX.Y.Z
|This branch is where we assemble the next release

|ssat-X.Y.Z_[change_type]-[frankenstyle]
|Branch containing a specific change, based on Moodle vX.Y.Z. This will be merged into the relevant integration branch.
|For example `ssat_3.6.0_plugin-webservice_restful` is where we add the submodule containing `moodle-webservice_restful` plugin

|===

NOTE:For an explanation of **Frankenstyle** see the https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Frankenstyle[Moodle Docs]

[[section-ssat-tags]]
=== Tags

We use tags to define SSAT release points, for example:

----
ssat-v3.6.0-0
ssat-v3.6.0-1
ssat-v3.6.0-2
