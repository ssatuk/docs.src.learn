= Using Discussion Forums

== Introduction

Discussion forums provide an opportunity for delegates and faculty to engage in asynchronous conversation around relevant topics.

NOTE: this needs to be fleshed out more, see note below about contributing ideas


== Examples

Our toolkit offers the following opportunities to use Discussion Forums:

* in Discourse, either public or restricted
* open or restricted discussion forums in xref:mahara:index.adoc[Mahara]
* within individual xref:moodle:index.adoc[Moodle] courses
* If a long-running group is configured as a Team in xref:officestaff:msteams:introduction.adoc[MS Teams] then the Team itself is a discussion forum
