= Reflective Learning

== Introduction

Reflective practice is a key part of professional learning where both experience and knowledge are essential components of progression.

There is a rich set of references to teacher education in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice#Teacher_educators[related Wikipedia article,role=external,window=_blank].


== Models of reflective practice

=== Gibbs Reflective Cycle

Learning researcher Graham Gibbs discussed the use of structured debriefing to facilitate the reflection involved in Kolb's experiential learning cycle.

=== Schon - reflection in action

Schon and Argyris coined the terms single-loop-learning and double-loop-learning to describe how practitioners respond to an error or other learning need. These concepts were further developed into the practices of _reflection-in-action_ and _reflection_after_action_ as summarised here:
