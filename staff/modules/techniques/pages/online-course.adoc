= Online Courses

Online courses can and should mix both asynchronous and synchronous techniques.

The key benefits of adding an online course to your delivery approach are:

* a container for multiple resources and activities (both sync and async)
* a way to pull together discussion within a cohort alongside material
* a mechanism for grading and feedback if that is an important part of your service
* easy to automate recognition for example certificates and digital badges
