= Sharing your work on a portfolio page

== Context

By default journal entries and artefacts you add to Mahara are private.

To share examples of your portfolio you need to create Pages (there's also a more advanced form of portfolio called Collections - these are made up of multiple pages and are not covered in this introductory page)

== Instructions

* xref:examples/create-the-page.adoc[Create the page]
* xref:examples/add-content-to-page.adoc[Add content to the page]
* Share the page (to follow)
