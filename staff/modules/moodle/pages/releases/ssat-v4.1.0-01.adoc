== Moodle version 4

=== User interface improvements

Moodle 4 contains significant improvements to the user interface, including 

* enhanced timeline and calendar on **Dashboard** page  
+
__this means sensible open and close dates for courses, and (where applicable) dates on activities is much more important for the delegate experience__
* a new page **My Courses** which shows all courses a delegate is registered on
* within each course a collapsible course index in the left-hand navigation
* an expandable "block drawer" in the right hand margin - individual course teachers can customise what blocks appear in this draw for their course

=== Big Blue Button

Moodle 4 provides the capability to integrate with Big Blue Button live web conferencing from within courses. We have currently disabled this feature pending review within SSAT.

=== Other changes

- Improvements to Quiz and Question Bank

- the option to set a time limit on Assignments

- In order to inform teaching decisions, Report Builder, a feature of Moodle Workplace, has been incorporated into Moodle 4.0. 
Managers can generate improved system-level and custom reports allowing educators to measure student progress, analyse the impact and improve learning programs.

== Moodle version 4.1

Moodle version 4.1 is a "Long Term Support" release - this will continue to receive feature patches until November 2023 and security patches until November 2025, an important consideration to help us manage the support workload for this platform.

=== Database activity

Improvements to the user experience of the Database activity, including a useful start page, an improved Image gallery preset, plus three new presets: Journal, Proposals and Resources, which can be previewed. These four ready-made presets mean that you can use and adapt one of the four on offer to fit your needs, without having to build a layout from nothing.

=== Gradebook

UX improvements have also been made to the Gradebook to make it easier to navigate. With Moodle LMS 4.1, a new 'Grades summary' page has been added to provide a summary of the grade averages for each course activity and can be filtered by activity. 
There is an improved 'User report' with a more modern design and collapsible categories, and a 'Single view report'â€™ with improved design and the ability to simply search by user, group or grade item, and more easily do bulk actions. 
This allows teachers and trainers to more easily analyse the success of formative and summative assessment and inform improvements to course design.
