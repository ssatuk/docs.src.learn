== Highlighted plugin - Tiles layout

This is also an opportunity to highlight a new course format that's available to SSAT teams, the Tiles Layout.

NOTE: an upgrade for this format has just become available and will be installed to our system before the start of September term 2021.

A course format which displays course topics as "Tiles", in a grid rather than as a list. When clicked, tile content is displayed under the tile with an animated transition. The layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. Within each tile, activities can also be set to display as "sub-tiles". For each tile, the teacher can pick an icon from a predefined set, or upload a background photo.
