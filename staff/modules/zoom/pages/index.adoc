== SSAT licensing

To use Zoom outside the free account limits a licence is required.

We have a small number of Zoom Pro licences in SSAT:

* the account owner licence permanently assigned to `webadmin@ssatuk.co.uk`
* a 500 user add-on that is normally left assigned to `zoombrand@ssatuk.co.uk`
* a small number of licences which are re-allocated as required for e-learning purposes

== Creating a Zoom meeting from within Moodle

There is a special linkage between Moodle and Zoom (details to be added to the Moodle documentation)

To make use of this:

* you **must** have a Zoom licence assigned to your personal SSAT email
* you **must** login to Moodle with your personal SSAT email
* your Moodle account must have **Teacher** role or greater in the course
* **do not** attempt to setup a Zoom meeting with another account and link it from inside the Moodle course
